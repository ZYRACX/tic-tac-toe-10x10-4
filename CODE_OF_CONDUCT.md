# Code of Conduct

## Preamble

Our project is dedicated to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors and participants. We expect everyone to adhere to this code of conduct during interactions related to the project.

## Scope

This code of conduct applies within all project spaces, including the GitHub repository, issue tracker, discussion forums, and any other channels associated with the project. It also applies to interactions between participants outside these spaces when related to project activities.

## Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Using inclusive language
- Being respectful to different viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Personal attacks
- Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without consent
- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by opening an issue on the [project's issue tracker](https://github.com/ZYRACX/tic-tac-toe-10x10-4/issues). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project maintainers are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.


Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the code of conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

## Resolution

In the event of a conflict or dispute, participants agree to engage in good faith dialogue to find a resolution that is respectful and considerate of all parties involved.
